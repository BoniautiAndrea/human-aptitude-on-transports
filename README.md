# Human Aptitude on Transports
A research on Human Aptitudes on Transports, a brief try to find some features from questionnaires that can be used to plan a suitable route and try to change behaviours.

This report studies personal spatial perception, sense of direction and navigation learning of individuals, the relation between them and
categorized personal traits and attitudes towards transport mode choice, from private car to public bus and underground/metro.
All these arguments are connected together through a literature research as an attempt to find nagivational and spatial traits that can
describe individuals’ preference on transport choice, from car to metro, and if it is not possible, to derive from these traits some more
generic psychological traits that can describe the transport choiche.
With these defined preferences, it is possible to build a route planner that satisfies user’s transport preferences to plan a trip by the most
favourite transport, and progressively try to induce the user to diverge step by step from that, trying to modify its preferences.
This could be used in people education in order to change transport choice from private cars to public transport, or to choose more
environment friendly modalities, or even both of them.
